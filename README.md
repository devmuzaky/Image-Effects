2. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
3. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
4. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
5. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
6. [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

These technologies work together to provide a seamless and responsive experience for users.

Rust and WebAssembly for Image Processing
-----------------------------------------

🦀 Rust is a systems programming language that is designed to be fast, safe, and reliable. In Image Effects, Rust is used
to write the core image processing algorithms that convert colored images to black and white, resize images, add a
blurry effect, and crop areas of an image. Rust's performance and safety features make it a great choice for this kind
of low-level, computationally intensive work.

🕸️ WebAssembly is a binary format that allows code written in programming languages other than JavaScript to be executed
in a web browser. In Image Effects, Rust code is compiled into WebAssembly using the `wasm-pack` tool, which creates a
binary file that can be executed in a web browser. This allows the image processing algorithms to run at near-native
speeds, even in a web browser.

🎨 The conversion of colored images to black and white, resizing of images, adding a blurry effect, and cropping of areas
of an image is performed by the Rust code compiled into WebAssembly. The algorithms are executed in the user's web
browser using WebAssembly, which allows the processing to be done quickly and efficiently.



Installation and Usage
----------------------

🚀 To install and run Image Effects, simply download or clone the repository, install the required technologies, and
launch the application. The application can be run locally on your machine, or it can be deployed to a web server for
others to use.
